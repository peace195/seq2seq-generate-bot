nice heater can heat the small room and also it s really sturdy i m using it through month 24hours and it s work fine without any problem it have a sound but not annoying sound just like a fan sound and about the turn off every minute you can fix this issue by putting some thick paper under the heater as you can see in the picture to change the balance then the heater will not turn off ever minute and become more quieter the only negative thing for me is the remote control doesn t have a timer button	nice	heater

great heater it is super quite and heats my sons room quickly the only downside for me is it is a little hard to get it to maintain the right temperature i like his room to stay around degrees at night and because it dose not have a temperature setting on thermostat you have to just turn dial till it turns off but a lot of times it will keep room too warm so i have to play with it a bit to get it where i want it but this is still a great heater if i was to buy again i would get a higher model with a digital temperature setting	heater	super
